# Transpose_a_Matrix_with_C
Transpose a user input 2-dimensional matrix and output it.

The program will ask the user to first input the dimension of the matrix (no larger than MAX), then the user will be prompted to input each element by row then by column.

The program will print the initial matrix and the transposed matrix.

The question I have is how to define a function that could properly takes a 2-d array of any length?
